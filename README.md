# Scrape cgeonline

The scraping is meant to retrieve the information for the release of
new dates for appointments to register births at the Spain Consulate in
Buenos Aires.

The website is fetched in a simple way using the requests library and
parsed with Beautifoul Soup. No need to involve a higher complexity
framework like Scrapy since it's a rather simple task.
